## Objective
Design and Build a motor to research efficiency

The purpose of this project was to design build and test and electric motor to reach a high level of efficiency. The primary focus was to increase working efficiency and see the application of different changes in the design. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of electronics, controllers, and electromagnetism.

### Skills Learned/Refined

- Electromagnetic system design and magnetic flux path considerations
- Three-phase motor topology and commutation concepts
- Coil winding techniques and phase configuration
- Arduino-based data acquisition and control integration
- Operation and integration of a 3-phase motor controller
- Phase voltage measurement using oscilloscope diagnostics
- Design in Fusion 360
- Prototyping using 3D printing

### Tools Used

- Fusion 360 (CAD design & modeling)
- Arduino IDE
- Oscilloscope measurement software/interface
- 3D printer
- Bench power supply
